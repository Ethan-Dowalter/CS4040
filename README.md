# CS4040 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Course Description - 
Introduces modern study of computer algorithms. Topics include correctness of algorithms, analysis of iterative and recursive algorithms, 
worst-case, best-case, average-case, and amortized behavior, design of algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, the greedy method, graph searching, 
and dynamic programming techniques. Selected additional topics may include computational geometry or NP-completeness.
